## Details:
Half-day Tutorial Session
International Supercomputing Conference 2019 (ISC19')
June 16th, 2019
Frankfurt, DE

Topic Area: Programming Models & Systems Software
Keywords: Containerized HPC, System Software and Runtime Systems, Scientific Software Development, DevOps

## Abstract: 

Within just the past few years, the use of containers has revolutionized the way in which industries and enterprises have developed and deployed computational software and distributed systems. The containerization model is gaining traction within the HPC community as well with the promise of improved reliability, reproducibility, and levels customization that are not otherwise possible on supercomputers previously. From the onset of containerization in HPC, Singularity has lead the way in providing container services, ranging from small clusters to entire supercomputers. 

This hands-on tutorial looks to train users on the usability of containers on HPC resources. Specifically, the tutorial will walk through the processes of creating, deploying, and running Singularity containers on a Linux cluster. We will provide a detailed background on Linux containers, along with introductory hands-on experience building and running containers on a cluster. Furthermore, the tutorial will provide more advanced information on how to run MPI-based HPC applications as well as cutting-edge machine learning frameworks. Users will leave the tutorial with a solid foundational understanding of how to utilize containers with HPC resources through Singularity, as well as an in-depth knowledge to deploy custom containers on their own resources.
